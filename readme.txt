== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I find my Grooveshark Widget ID? =
To find your widgets IDs you must have a [Grooveshark](http://www.grooveshark.com "Grooveshark") account or you can use a friend's ID if you don't have an account yet. 

The most unsophisticated way to find your widget id is to go on the [Grooveshark Widget](http://widgets.grooveshark.com "Grooveshark Widget") page, to login and make a new widget from [Make a Widget](http://widgets.grooveshark.com/make?new "Make a Widget") link or if you already have one or more widgets go on [My Widgets](http://widgets.grooveshark.com/my_widgets "My Widgets") page and click on the "Get Embed Code" link. In the next page you can extract the ID from the URL which is in the browser address bar, as shown in the example below.

Example:
This is a link to one of my widgets: `http://widgets.grooveshark.com/finished?widgetid=8645177`, you can see that the widget ID is clearly defined at the end of the link after the "`widgetid=`", you must copy and paste this code, which in this case is `8645177`, in the Widget ID field on the Grooveshark Widget settings panel.
